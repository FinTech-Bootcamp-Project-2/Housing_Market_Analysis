# Housing_Market_Analysis

# Main Question:
We are building a model to predict how affordable are house mortgage in comparison to average income in the future.

Machine learning models used to predict Canadian mortgage rates, average household income, and average mortgage value/payment

# To-Dos

1. Mortagage rate
    a. How does the rate changes in the future? 
    b. Major factors affect Mortgage rate -- Inflation rate, GDP growth, employment rate, Polity interest rate => neural network
2. Affordability
    a. Prediction model of average household income in the future => machine learning model
    b. prediction model of average mortage(total + monthly) in the future => machine learning model
